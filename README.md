# Magicode

A 3D RTS multiplayer game where each character controls 6 mage units. 
Every mage can cast spells which have been programmed beforehand by the player. The goal is to kill all the mages of the enemy player(s).

# Visual programming

We have created our own Scratch-like visual programming system which has standard programming constructs like loops and conditionals
and also some constructs specific to the game.

# Multiplayer

To implement the multiplayer, we have used Mirror, a community maintained networking library which uses some parts of Unity's abandoned 
UNET Networking System.
